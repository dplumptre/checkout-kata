## Checkout Kata

I did not persist data so I used arrays, I decided to use just php not laravel

### Instruction
- After pulling the repo
- Do composer dump-autoload : Generate the autoload files
- Drop the file in folder where php will work like (like Laravel Valet, Homestead, XAMPP, etc.)

### Note
- Please make sure to use  PHP 8.1.

### Your index.php 
- An array showing the sku and the original price
- An array of the classes of promotion
- The checkout
- Manipulate the items to be scanned in the index page to test eg $m->scan('A');
